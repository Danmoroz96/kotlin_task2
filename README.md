# Kotlin Functional Programming Practice

This program practices core functional programming concepts in Kotlin: `filter`, `map`, and `reduce` (using `fold`).

## Program Description

The program initializes a list of integers from 1 to 25. It then performs a sequence of operations on this list:

1.  **Filter:** Selects all **even numbers** from the initial list.
2.  **Map:** Calculates the **square** of each number in the resulting list of even numbers.
3.  **Reduce/Fold:** Calculates the **sum** of all the squared even numbers.

The results of each step are printed with clear labels.
